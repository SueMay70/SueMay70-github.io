	<h3>Founder & CEO</h3><p style="color: black;">A Lawyer with a lifetime's experience in construction, it was congruous to focus on construction law after becoming a Lawyer.</p>

<p style="color: black;">With 30 years experience working in Central Australia constructing roads, buildings and public infrastructure, and eventually specialising on 'difficult' construction projects, I have a breadth of knowledge of the difficulties and injustices faced daily by construction and contract workers. <br>
										I also have intimate knowledge and understanding of the building and construction environment, terminologies, and the unfair practices often employed against hard-working Contractors. 
										Now, as a Lawyer, I also know the law, how to best apply it to individual circumstances, and receive great satisfaction helping clients with my in-depth understanding of their problem.
										Contractors that are seeking a legal solution to their problem need both legal and industry-knowledgeable help. I have that rare combination of assets, which enables me to truly understand the issues of a case so that I can work with clients to develop a suitable solution.
